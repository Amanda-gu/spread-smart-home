  The article “Honeywell, I’m Home! The Internet of Things and the New Domestic Landscape” by Justin McGuirk, published in e-flux Journal #64, examines the evolving role of domestic spaces in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). McGuirk reflects on the 1972 MoMA exhibition “Italy: The New Domestic Landscape,” which showcased innovative domestic designs. He contrasts this with contemporary developments where companies like Honeywell introduce IoT devices that collect data from our homes, raising questions about privacy, control, and the transformation of domestic life into a data-driven environment.
The article delves into how these technological advancements are reshaping our understanding of home, moving beyond physical architecture to include digital infrastructures that monitor and influence our daily routines. McGuirk critiques the lack of architectural discourse on these changes, urging a reevaluation of how design and technology intersect in the domestic sphere.
In essence, McGuirk's work challenges readers to consider the implications of IoT in our homes, not just as conveniences but as elements that redefine the very concept of domestic space.

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>We wanted to explore the idea of companies taking our data, and it being hidden in a carefully packaged product. While behind the scenes the data is being used for god knows what. We wanted to channel that invisible wall with a dark theme so we tried to use visuals that matched the terminal in a computer.</p>
